#+TITLE: TODO List

1. Split instruction encodings out to separate file and automatically generate the Chisel & documentation from it.
   (Write once and run script to re-build the instruction encodings & documentation)
2. Support more complex RoCC instruction decoding (if need be).
   Look at Rocket's ~IDecode.scala~ & ~Decode.scala~ files.
   ~IDecode.scala~ deals with mapping the particular bit patterns to signals.
   ~Decode.scala~ deals with using a QMCMinimizer to generate a truth table to decode against.
   Instructions that use ~?~ have the ~?~ ignored by the minimizer.
3. Get testing to understand the RoCC interrupt signal from the CSRs and return a non-zero test exit code.
