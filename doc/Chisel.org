* Unofficial Style Guide
There exists an [[https://github.com/ccelio/chisel-style-guide][unofficial style guide]] for Chisel.
Overall, I tend to follow what it says, as it is fairly sensible.

This style guide is updated for Chisel 3!
This is a particularly important point as there are relatively few projects integrated with Chipyard that use Chisel 3.
